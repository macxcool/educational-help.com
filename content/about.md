In 1994, Maurice (Moe) McLauchlin, a recently retired special education teacher, organized a group of retired and younger teachers to assist students in London and surrounding area in response to recent changes in the educational system. Moe donated his services for twenty years until retirement, and the business is run unofficially as "not for profit". The first office was called Lambeth Learning Centre and is now the head office for Educational Help Centres Inc.. There are two other groups of teachers in London (northwest and northeast) and one in St. Thomas as well as administrators and teachers in Lambton-Kent. Currently, 50 certified teachers assist students from JK to 2nd Year University and College.<br>
