## Learning Challenged Students Matter
### By Moe McLauchlin

"We have collaborately written a book especially for you (teacher) and you (parent) focusing on assisting struggling students in the classroom. We are a group of "Special Educational" teachers with over 100 years of experience, collectively, teaching these unfortunate students. Most are bright and creative but unique in the way they learn; as a result too many of them are "falling through the cracks". For teachers and parents to appreciate, this book is both informative and practical. Assisting learning-challenged students is not a job but rather a "calling". Let's do it together."
